Description:

0-safe_print_list.py: Program prints x elements of a list.
st can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
x represents the number of elements to print.
x can be bigger than the length of my_list.
Returns the real number of elements printed.


1-safe_print_integer.py: Program prints an integer with "{:d}".format().
value can be any type (integer, string, etc.).
The integer should be printed followed by a new line.
Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer).
Otherwise, returns False.


2-safe_print_list_integers.py: Program prints the first x elements of a list and only integers.
my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.).
All integers have to be printed on the same line followed by a new line - other type of value in the list must be skipped (in silence).
x represents the number of elements to access in my_list.
x can be bigger than the length of my_list - if itâ€™s the case, an exception is expected to occur.
Returns the real number of integers printed.


3-safe_print_division.py: Program divides 2 integers and prints the result.
You can assume that a and b are integers.
The result of the division should print on the finally: section preceded by Inside result:
Returns the value of the division, otherwise: None.
You have to use try: / except: / finally:
